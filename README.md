# Rosies-Bar
Automatic dog-feeder


# TODO
* Automatic timestamping after feeding. TO check if the dog has not been previously feed (ie. after a reboot)
* Force feeding with external button.
* Automatic software launching (systemd job ?)
* Check every minute for feeding (cron job ? cron-like python lib?)


# FAQ
* What happens if a croquette is stuck between the motor ?
  * We specifically chose a motor strong enough to break the croquette if that happens.
